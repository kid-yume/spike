&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Welcome! Thanks for taking the time out to review and analayze my portfolio as I document the options that I am investing in based off signals provided by our 
pal, Spike! Remeber. This is development and if you are reviewing this page, I not only trust you but I am inviting you to help in the growth of Spike. I will be 
detailing the options I have purchased since March 3th and providing my own little analysis on them each week. There may be gaps due to me making some code 
changes. Remember since my funds are limited spike monitors over 500 symbols daily! This is only a taste of what spike can do! 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please remember that these signals are not perfected and any time you invest in the market you incur risks so please manage your risks and only invest what you 
are willing to lose if you decide to follow my trades. In no way shape or form am I credentialed to tell you or give advice on how to invest. This is merely a 
development platform where traders have agreed to review my trades and provide input and their thoughts on different things spike should be aware of. With all the 
red tape out the way lets get to it!
  
## Things to keep in mind
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a day trader and one who follows momentum. Which is why I have called my strategy FIT(Following Institutionalized Trades). WIth that being said, Spike is a 
creation modeled after my one ideas, thoughts, and needs. This includes understanding why someone like me buys options and why institutions buys options. I buy 
options for profit and institutions buys them for fullfillment. Wait dont institutions profit too when they purchase options? The answer is yes and this will go 
into theories and we will go off topic. However I made this statement merely to say that when a trader like me purchases an option I will eventually sell it. 
However, when an institution purchases theirs they will actual use it to buy or sell 100 shares of whatever stock.  I thrive on votality and I do not make money in 
markets that are not volatile. *At least quick money lol 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spike's signals let me know when abnormal volume is taking place and to take a look. They are not 100% and could be for a plethora 
of 
reasons. However, this strategy has served me very well and you find that in my documentation there is something to be found in this strategy. I will present my 
trades, following an analyzation of the movement, and at the end Conclude the different things I have noticed. If you find something else please do not hesitate 
to email me at adowning@bottom-feeders.com. I do check this email quite often and honestly Im more likely to reply there then I am a text message. ^__^ Without 
further adou please review and provide feedback! if you want to join our text group please shoot me an email with your phone number. 
 
## The Experiment
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With this first round of investments. When Spike sent a signal I went ahead and made the purchase within the hour. For the purity of trying 
to put myself in Spike's shoes I kept this constant through every trade this go round. However, You will notice how I started to make adjustments to exit points as 
the trades develop.  I also am keeping it to only making purchases on Monday just to test the waters of keeping an option of longer then a day if necessary and Monday is one of the busiest days in the Stock Market due to the long weekends.(Two days of a closed market is very long lol )

 ## In Conclusion
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To conclude my findings. I have found that we are successfull in quite a few areas including 
* Achieved Goal of Finding symbols with volatility of $1.00 movement that can provide provide 100%+ profit. 
* Portfolio went from $400 to $800 in two weeks. If not for the loss of the ATVI we would have been at $1000!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now there is def room for improvement.
* Achieve more precise Entries or possibly add an additional signal for actually taking the position 
* Limit taking or leaving positions on Market Open 

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trick will be teaching Spike how to ride trends out and identify entries based on indicators that will tell us when either buying or 
 selling has been exhausted. 
 I will be enabling "volume Area", MACID , and RSI indicators to aid in these efforts and again all input is welcomed and much needed! I appreciate you guys 
 reviewing these findings and look forward to your suggestions and trading with yall! We will be ready for the Amazon split and lets make money!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hoped to accomplish when I sought out to make a stock 
screener. With so many symbols out there its almost impossible to be able to just find the right ones and most traders tend to stick to a symbol to trade on that 
they get familiar with. This way we get exposure to not only other stokks out there but these kinds of scans are def. Sneak peeks to potential breakouts in the 
future and hey you might find a symbol you wanna actually invest in and hold shares in.
